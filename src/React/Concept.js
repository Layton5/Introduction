        Letâ€™s say one of your friends posted a photo on Facebook. If you like
        the photo and then you started checking out the comments too. Now as you
        browsing over comments you can see that the likes count has increased by
        100 since you liked the picture, even without reloading the page. This
        magical change in count is due to ReactJS. Note: React is not a
        framework. It is just a library developed by Facebook to solve some
        problems that we were facing earlier.
