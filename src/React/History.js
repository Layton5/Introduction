        While building client-side application, a team of Facebook developers
        found that DOM is slow. Document Object Model (DOM) is an application
        programming interface(API) for HTML and XML documents. It defines the
        logical structure of documents and how a document is accessed and
        manipulated. To make it faster, React implements a virtual DOM which is
        basically a DOM tree representation in JavaScript, and React was
        invented. // ReactJS is updated so frequently, that it is quite
        difficult to navigate the version, which comes with new features every
        time, each time it comes with new features. The current stable version
        of ReactJS is 18.2.0 and released on June 14, 2022 and the first release
        was on May 29, 2013.
