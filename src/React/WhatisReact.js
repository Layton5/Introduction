          ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library used to create user
          interfaces in a declarative and efficient way. It is a component-based
          front-end library responsible only for the view layer of a Model View
          Controller(MVC) architecture. React is used to create modular user
          interfaces and promotes the development of reusable UI components that
          display dynamic data.
